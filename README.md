System Analysis and Design

DriverPass, a fictitious company with the mission of helping driving students pass the DMV driver's test has asked us to develop an online system to handle their information needs. This includes a number of objectives such as scheduling driving appointments, managing payment information, and submission of written tests.

I feel that the bulk of my work in this class was spent creating UML diagrams, and I came a long way from knowing virtually nothing about the design of such diagrams to where I became comfortable switching my mindset between various types of diagrams such as sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams.

If I were to pick one thing in this directory to enhance and revise, it would be my activity diagram that outlines user login. I would like to make it more complete, despite the complexity involved in doing it. I cut it short because it was getting complex; but I feel it would be possible to flesh it out with at least a bit more of the options availble during a login session.

When designing my system, I used the interview with DriverPass extensively to help design a system I felt should work to meet those requirements. Listening to a client during a software project outline helps, but one thing I felt was missing was input from users of the system as the design was made more concrete through diagrams.

We didn't actually write any code during this project, but if we had it would be under the assumption we were working on a larger team and designing the system with some form of management either a waterfall structure or an agile methodology. From what I've read about agile is that it can get much better results but has the drawback that a lot of implementations don't really follow agile but rather set their software into motion with waterfall methodology using a few of the scrum/agile approaches. Another problem companies have is that they embrace agile for the sake of agile, rather than using it as a tool to correctly code.
